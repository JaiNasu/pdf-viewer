\section*{Preface}

This is a introductory text for preliminaries of particle physics and covers the basics of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Analytical Mechanics
  \item Field Theory
  \item Special Relativity
  \item Quantum Mechanics
  \item Some Mathematics
  \item Extra topics
\end{itemize}

The text is intended to be a self-contained introduction to the topics, and is meant to be a mere introduction - a preparation for not freaking out before reading more advanced texts.
By that I mean the understanding on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Greek letters (may be most important, really.)
  \item High School calculus + partial derivatives
  \item Vectors and (some matrix algebra)
  \item Newtonian Mechanics and Electromagnetism
  \item Some basic knowledge on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics
\end{itemize}
