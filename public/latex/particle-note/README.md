# Review For Particle Physics
If you are here for the notes, you can find them in the `notes.pdf` file in this directory, or click the following link:
### [Content](notes.pdf#page=1)

Please note that this document is a work in progress, and I will update it as I learn more about the subject. If you have any suggestions or corrections, please feel free to contact me.

## Some Remarks

Most of code is taken from "Charlie's Math Template": https://github.com/SeniorMars/dotfiles/tree/main/latex_template and adapted to my needs.
Much thanks to him (his YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@SeniorMarsTries), and all the faults in this document belong to me.

This document uses LuaLaTeX, so if you want to compile this source, you need to use `lualatex`.
Also, some of the fonts are not super common, so you may need to install them on your system, as well as some other niche things like pdfx compliance.



## Table of Contents
 - Mathematical Remarks
 - Analytical Mechanics

 - Extra: some things I find interesting, but felt like they didn't fit into the main text
